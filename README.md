# javascript-dot2dot
Stupidly simple Javascript Dot to Dot Drawer with a visible y intercept, and a button to export as a lisp s-expression

I just use this to draw 2d shapes to use as generatrices for surfaces of revolutions, or extrusions.
It waas easier than making a frontend in R5RS Scheme which is where my best 3d library is.
